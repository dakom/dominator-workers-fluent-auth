# Text strings

Frontend text is in [frontend locale](../frontend/src/locale)
Backend text (i.e. email text) is currently hardcoded in the source code

# Frontend theme

It's all in [frontend theme](../frontend/src/theme)

All the colors, sizes, breakpoints, etc. should be easy to reason about in the source code
